The Q-MediScan quantum AI system analyzed her biomarker data and detected subtle patterns

have missed them for another 18 months.

Thanks to this early detection, {persona['name']} received treatment when the cancer was still 
in Stage 1. Her prognosis is excellent, with a 99% five-year survival rate.

"Quantum computing didn't just detect my cancer - it saved my life," {persona['name']} reflects.
